# DeepDive-Vector
implementation of a custom vector. goals:
1. to be equivalent to STL offered vector
2. better than stl vector by introducing custom policies and allocators etc.

This Repo will deep Dive into stl offered vector, by first creating a custom implementation of vector that matches exactly with the STL one.
As the functionality improves, later custom allocators and custom policies/functionalities will be introduced and compared with the stl vector via 
microbenchmarking on various algorithsm.
