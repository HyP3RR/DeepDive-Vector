# DeepDive-Vector
implementation of vector, goal to be equivalent to STL offered vector and then beyond by introducing custom policies and allocators etc.

This Repo will deep Dive into stl offered vector, by first creating a custom implementation of vector that matches exactly with the STL one.
As the functionality improves, later custom allocators and custom policies/functionalities will be introduced and compared with the stl vector,
microbenchmarking to compare the performances of stl vector and my custom one for various algorithms.
